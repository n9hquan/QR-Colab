        "Welcome to Google Colaboratory (Colab), i.e. the Python editor slash notebook app we are using throughout this semester! \n",
        "\n",
        "To many people, including experienced programmers, installing Python and the magical toolkits working with it on their personal computers can be quite confusing and frustrating. Furthermore, not all personal computers are powerful enough to run resource-hungry programs, and some of the tasks we will explore in this course can be quite resource-hungry.\n",
        "\n",
        "That's where Colab comes in! Think of it primarily as a Python code editor that comes pre-packed with everything you need in this course and — wait for it — **runs on the cloud**! Whenever you run a Python program on Colab, it is a powerful computer somewhere geographically far away from you that executes the code, not *your* computer.\n",
        "\n",
        "It also comes with these handy features:\n",
        "1. It can be connected to Google Drive. That means it can read files from and export files to your Google Drive.\n",
        "2. It can be shared like other Google productivity products, such as Docs, Spreadsheets, and Slides.\n",
        "3. **It can act secondarily as an interactive notebook** in which you can insert photos, videos, and widgets for visualizing and gaining insights into data (which will be super useful in the later stages of your final project).\n",
        "\n",
        "Please follow the instructions below to start exploring Colab."
